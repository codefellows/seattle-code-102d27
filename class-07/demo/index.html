                <p>Star Wars and Star Trek are both science based and involve space travel and aliens. The
                    Star Trek television series was originally produced in 1966, and it influenced the 1977 beginning
                    of the popular Star Wars films. In 1979, the first Star Trek movie was released. Star Wars and
                    Star Trek movies have more or less the same setting or surroundings but have extremely
                    different levels of on-screen conflict, unique recognizable characters, and slightly different
                    genres.
                    Star Wars movies all center around the conflict between the Rebel Alliance, who fight for
                    their freedom, and the Galactic Empire, who fight to keep control. A child can identify this as a
                    conflict between good and evil. Adults identify the sides of the conflict by their names: the Sith
                    (evil) and the Jedi (good). Star Wars even color-codes these groups by their lightsabers, as if to
                    highlight the ongoing conflict by labeling the good guys with green lightsabers and the bad guys
                    with red lightsabers. These two powerful groups, the Sith and the Jedi, can even further be
                    identified as the dark side and the light side. Without these conflicts, the Star Wars movies
                    would essentially have no plot.
                    On the other hand, Star Trek movies feature the conflict of a crew having to make moral
                    decisions about various dilemmas. For example, they are put into situations in which they have
                    to decide whether or not to protect the peace of others, stand against racism, and solve other
                    political or ethical problems.</p>

                <p>One of the most recognizable characters from Star Wars is Darth Vader, also called Lord
                    Vader because he is a Sith lord. Darth Vader was a former Jedi (Anakin Skywalker), who was
                    tempted by the dark side and chose poorly. He has remarkable strength and looks extremely
                    intimidating because of his apparel. He dresses in all black and has an overall dark appearance.
                    He has an exceptionally deep, raspy voice, and his breaths sound labored and mechanical
                    through his dark helmet. Darth Vader is a fierce and unforgiving leader, a leader whom few
                    people have dared to stand up to.
                    While the most-recognizable character of Star Wars is an evil character, the most widely
                    known character of Star Trek is a good guy, Spock. Spock, or Mr. Spock, is a half-human, halfVulcan crew member. Spock, Captain Kirk’s first officer, uses his Vulcan mind and his beyondaverage intelligence to help make the decisions that he and his fellow crewmates are faced with
                    on their many Starfleet voyages. Spock faces slight conflicts within himself throughout the
                    movies due to being only part human. His Vulcan side makes him think with only pure logic, so
                    when his feelings and emotions arise from his human side, he is often left confused.
                    Star Wars and Star Trek also differ in their genres. Star Wars is science fantasy. The
                    force that Star Wars revolves around is more magical than fictional, making it science fantasy.
                    The force could essentially be described as a universal energy source that is a part of all living
                    things, and with particular skill or abilities, it can be manipulated. The force is pure fantasy
                    compared to the real world, considering it allows people to control others’ minds, allows
                    telekinesis to take place, and can even make a person or being more physically skilled. All of
                    these abilities that are accessible through the force are science fantasy instead of science fiction
                    because they are not even remotely possible.</p>

                <p>Star Trek, however, is classified as science fiction. Unlike its cousin, the main concepts 
                    Herron 3
                    in Star Trek are slightly based on capable technology and/or concepts. None of the concepts that
                    Star Trek uses are as farfetched as that of the force seen in Star Wars. For example, the main
                    pieces of technology that the crew is constantly using are their personal communication devices
                    and their triangulation devices. Both of these are nearly identical in concept to the smart phones
                    society uses today. Some of the other technology in Star Trek is slightly less feasible, yet there
                    remains the slight possibility that one day in the future science will have the capability to teleport
                    people. Perhaps weaponry that uses lasers, such as the ones in Star Trek, may also become a
                    technology norm sometime in the future.
                    Star Wars and Star Trek are two films that are very similar in their settings but have
                    tremendously diverse levels of conflict throughout the movies, exceptionally exclusive
                    characters, and genres that differ from one another. Star Wars is a movie series which relies
                    almost entirely on war or good versus evil, while Star Trek is much more concerned with moral
                    dilemmas and ethical decisions. The characters that are most commonly associated with each
                    series are also different because Spock is only half-human and is not a villain, but Darth Vader is
                    a human villain. Star Wars is classified as science fantasy because the presence of the force is a
                    rather magical concept. Star Trek, on the other hand, is thought to be science fiction because the
                    contents of the movies are not fantasy based and have at least the possibility of being true or
                    achievable.</p>
